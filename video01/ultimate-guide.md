## Introduction to AI Coding

### What is AI Coding?
AI coding (also called "Vibe Coding" in earlier videos) is a revolutionary approach where you build applications by having conversations with AI coding agents. Instead of writing code line by line, you describe what you want in natural language, and AI generates the code for you.

### How It Works
- Write a prompt describing your application
- AI agent processes your request
- Complete, working code is generated
- You can see live preview instantly
- Make changes through conversation
- Deploy directly to production

## Setting Up Your Environment

#### Option 1: V0.dev (Recommended)
1. Go to https://v0.dev
2. Sign up with GitHub (recommended) or email
3. Free tier gives you enough credits to start
4. No installation required

#### Option 2: Bolt.new
1. Visit https://bolt.new

## Building Your First Portfolio Website

### Step 1: Planning Your Portfolio

Before writing your prompt, list what you want:
- Homepage with introduction
- Resume/experience page
- About me section
- Projects showcase
- Contact information
- Social media links

### Step 2: Writing Your First Prompt

#### Basic Prompt Example:
```
Create my portfolio website with homepage, resume page, and about me section.
```

#### Enhanced Prompt Example:
```
Create a modern, professional portfolio website with the following:

STRUCTURE:
- Homepage with hero section, my name, and tagline
- Resume page with experience and education
- About me page with personal story and skills
- Projects section with case studies
- Contact page with form

INFORMATION:
[Attach resume or provide details]
- LinkedIn: [your-linkedin]
- GitHub: [your-github]
- Twitter: [your-twitter]

DESIGN:
- Modern and clean
- Mobile responsive
- Dark mode option
- Smooth animations

TECHNOLOGY:
- Next.js for SEO
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript for type safety
```

### Step 3: Running Your Prompt

1. Paste your prompt in the text box
2. Attach any files (resume, images)
3. Click "Generate" or press Enter
4. Wait 30-60 seconds for generation

### Step 4: Reviewing Generated Application

The AI will create:
- Complete file structure
- All pages and components
- Styling and animations
- Responsive design
- Working navigation

Check each section:
- Does homepage look professional?
- Is information accurate?
- Are all links working?
- Mobile view working?

### Step 5: Making Improvements

Example improvement prompts:
```
"Add my profile photo to the homepage hero section"
```

```
"Change the color scheme to use blue and gray"
```

```
"Add a blog section where I can write articles"
```

```
"Make the contact form functional with email integration"
```

## Understanding the Generated Code

### File Structure (Next.js Example)
```
portfolio-website/
├── app/                  # Application pages
│   ├── page.tsx         # Homepage
│   ├── about/page.tsx   # About page
│   ├── resume/page.tsx  # Resume page
│   └── layout.tsx       # Main layout
├── components/          # Reusable components
│   ├── Header.tsx      # Navigation
│   ├── Footer.tsx      # Footer
│   └── Hero.tsx        # Hero section
├── styles/             # CSS files
├── public/             # Images and assets
└── package.json        # Dependencies
```

### Key Technologies Used
- **Next.js**: React framework for production
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **TypeScript**: Type-safe JavaScript
- **React**: UI component library

### Important Files to Know
- `package.json` - Lists all dependencies
- `app/page.tsx` - Your homepage
- `app/layout.tsx` - Common layout for all pages
- `components/` - Reusable pieces of your site

## Deployment and Going Live

### Method 1: Direct Deployment (Easiest)

1. Click "Deploy" or "Publish" button
2. Choose a URL (e.g., yourname.vercel.app)
3. Click confirm
4. Your site is live in 1-2 minutes!

### Method 2: Custom Domain Setup

1. Purchase domain from:
   - Namecheap
   - GoDaddy
   - Google Domains

2. In your AI tool, add custom domain:
   - Click Settings → Domains
   - Add your domain
   - Copy DNS records provided

3. Configure DNS:
   - Log into domain provider
   - Go to DNS settings
   - Add CNAME record:
     - Type: CNAME
     - Name: www
     - Value: [provided by tool]
   - Add A record:
     - Type: A
     - Name: @
     - Value: [provided IP]

4. Wait 5-30 minutes for propagation

### Method 3: GitHub Integration

1. Connect GitHub account
2. Create new repository
3. Name it (e.g., "my-portfolio")
4. Code automatically syncs
5. Can edit in VS Code later

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Generated Site Doesn't Match Vision
**Solution**: Be more specific in prompts
```
Instead of: "Make it modern"
Try: "Use a minimalist design with sans-serif fonts, white background, and blue accents"
```

### Issue 2: Information Not Displaying
**Solution**: Provide information clearly
```
"My name is [Your Name], I'm a [Your Role] with experience in [Your Skills]"
```

### Issue 3: Mobile View Broken
**Solution**: Request specific fix
```
"Fix the mobile navigation menu - it should be a hamburger menu that opens a slide-out panel"
```

### Issue 4: Deployment Failed
**Solution**: 
- Check for errors in console
- Try deploying again
- Use a different URL if taken

### Issue 5: Custom Domain Not Working
**Solution**:
- Verify DNS records are correct
- Wait up to 24 hours for propagation
- Check SSL certificate status

## Security Best Practices

### Do's:
- Review generated code before deploying
- Keep API keys in environment variables
- Use HTTPS for production sites
- Regular security updates
- Validate all user inputs

### Don'ts:
- Never expose API keys in code
- Don't skip understanding the code
- Avoid storing sensitive data client-side
- Don't ignore security warnings

## Advanced Features to Add

### After mastering basics, try:

1. **Contact Form with Email**
```
"Add a working contact form that sends emails to my Gmail"
```

2. **Blog with Markdown**
```
"Create a blog section where I can write posts in Markdown"
```

3. **Project Filtering**
```
"Add category filters to the projects page (Web, Mobile, Design)"
```

4. **Analytics**
```
"Integrate Google Analytics to track visitors"
```

5. **Newsletter Signup**
