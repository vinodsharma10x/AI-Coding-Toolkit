👉 Transition: “Let me show you what I mean…”

1:10 – Demo 1: Character Consistency

Story setup:
“Let’s say I want a startup mascot — something I can reuse everywhere. In the old world, I’d need a designer. In the Nano Banana world…”

👉 Demo prompt:
Upload your photo OR create a simple AI character.
Prompt: ‘Make this character a startup founder in a hoodie, standing in front of a whiteboard.’

Follow-up prompt: ‘Now put the same character in a suit, giving a pitch on stage.’

Narration:
“Notice how the face, the style, the character stays the same — just different outfits and scenarios. For a startup, this means one consistent brand character across your app, pitch deck, and social media.”

1:50 – Demo 2: Multi-Step Editing

Story setup:
“Now imagine you’re designing your office setup for a demo day. You don’t have budget for an interior designer — but you want to visualize it.”

👉 Demo prompt:
Start with an empty room photo.
Step 1: ‘Paint the walls light blue.’
Step 2: ‘Add a bookshelf and a startup trophy on it.’
Step 3: 'add a desk and place a laptop on the desk showing my SaaS dashboard.’

Narration:
“This is the power of iterative editing — you don’t have to get it right in one shot. Just like a startup sprint, you build step by step until you get the result you want.”

2:30 – Demo 3: Blending

Story setup:
“Here’s another scenario: marketing visuals. You want to show your product in action but don’t have professional photography.”

👉 Demo prompt:
Upload a product screenshot + a stock image of someone working.
Prompt: ‘Blend the two so the laptop in this scene shows my app on screen’

Narration:
“That’s ad-ready material in seconds. No photo studio, no designer — just a few cents per image.”

3:00 – Demo 4: Style Transfer

Story setup:
“Branding is everything. You don’t want your startup looking generic — you want it stylish.”

👉 Demo prompt:
Upload a plain product screenshot + an aesthetic image.
Prompt: ‘Apply the clean Apple-style minimalism from this reference photo to my app screenshot.’

Narration:
“Now your MVP looks like it’s been touched by a professional design team — but it’s just you and Nano Banana.”

3:30 – Reflection (Startup Angle)

“For indie devs and startups, these demos aren’t just party tricks. They solve real bottlenecks:

Faster pitch decks

Quicker ad testing

Professional branding without a design budget

Even full asset packs for games or apps”

“And the best part? The API costs just around 3.9 cents per image. That’s a design department… for the price of coffee.”

4:00 – Closing Story & Call to Action

“So here’s the bottom line.
Every founder knows design can slow you down. With Nano Banana, you skip the bottleneck and move straight to execution.

You focus on shipping the product — Nano Banana handles the visuals.
And suddenly, your two-person startup looks like a 20-person company.”
