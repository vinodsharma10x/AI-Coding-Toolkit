## Method 1: Text Prompts

### Basic vs Enhanced Prompts
**Basic**: "Create a task management app"

**Enhanced**: "Create a task management app with:
- User authentication
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Due dates and priority levels
- Categories and tags
- Progress tracking
- Dark/light mode
- Mobile responsive design
- Using React with Tailwind CSS"

### Key Elements for Better Prompts
- Features you want
- Tech stack preferences
- Design style
- User experience details
- Specific functionality

## Method 2: Screenshot to Code
- Take screenshots of websites you like
- Upload to AI coding tools
- Get instant recreation of design
- Customize with your content
- Perfect for landing pages

## Method 3: Figma to Code

### Three Approaches:
1. **Using Figma Link** - Share design URL directly
2. **Screenshot Method** - Export and upload designs
3. **Copy Figma Code** - Use Figma's code export

### Best For:
- Designer-developer collaboration
- Pixel-perfect implementations
- Complex UI designs

## Method 4: Using Boilerplates

### Popular Boilerplate Sources:
- **Shipfast** - SaaS starter
- **Create T3 App** - Full-stack TypeScript
- **Next.js Templates** - Official starters
- **Vercel Templates** - Production-ready apps

### Benefits:
- Pre-configured setup
- Best practices included
- Authentication ready
- Database configured

## Method 5: Existing Code Enhancement

### How to Enhance:
1. Upload existing code
2. Ask for specific improvements
3. Request new features
4. Fix bugs and issues
5. Refactor for better performance

### Example Prompts:
- "Add authentication to this app"
- "Make this component responsive"
- "Convert to TypeScript"
- "Add error handling"

## Bonus Method: Combining Approaches

### Power Combination:
1. Start with a boilerplate
2. Use screenshot for design inspiration
3. Enhance with specific prompts
4. Import Figma components
5. Refine with iterations

## Tools Mentioned
- **Bolt.new** - Full-stack development
- **V0** - UI components
- **Figma** - Design tool
- **GitHub** - Code repository
- **Visual Studio Code** - Code editor
- **Lovable** - Production apps

## Pricing Considerations
- Most tools offer free tiers
- Boilerplates: Free to $200+
- AI tools: $0-50/month


## Pro Tips
- Start simple, then enhance
- Keep prompts specific and detailed
- Use reference materials (screenshots, links)
- Iterate based on results
- Save good prompts for reuse
