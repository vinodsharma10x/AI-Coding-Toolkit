## Introduction

This guide teaches you five powerful methods to start building with AI coding tools. Whether you're a complete beginner or have some coding experience, these methods will help you create professional applications quickly.

## Method 1: Text Prompts Mastery

### Understanding Prompt Engineering

Text prompts are the foundation of AI coding. The quality of your output directly depends on the quality of your input.

### Basic Prompt Structure

```
[What to build] + [Features] + [Technology] + [Design requirements]
```

### Evolution of a Prompt

#### Level 1: Basic
```
"Create a todo app"
```

#### Level 2: With Features
```
"Create a todo app with:
- Add and delete tasks
- Mark as complete
- Due dates"
```

#### Level 3: Detailed Specification
```
"Create a todo app with:

FEATURES:
- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Set due dates and priorities
- Categories (Work, Personal, Shopping)
- Search and filter capabilities
- Drag and drop to reorder

DESIGN:
- Modern, minimal interface
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Mobile responsive
- Smooth animations
- Color-coded priorities

TECHNICAL:
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Local storage for data
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Export to JSON"
```

### Advanced Prompt Templates

#### SaaS Application Template
```
Create a [type] SaaS application for [target users] that helps them [main benefit].

CORE FEATURES:
- User authentication and profiles
- [Feature 1 specific to your app]
- [Feature 2 specific to your app]
- [Feature 3 specific to your app]

USER TYPES:
- Free users: [limitations]
- Pro users: [full features]
- Admin: [admin capabilities]

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Database: [PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB]
- Authentication: [JWT/OAuth]
- Payment: [Stripe/PayPal]
- Hosting: [Vercel/Netlify]

DESIGN PREFERENCES:
- Style: [Modern/Classic/Playful]
- Colors: [Color scheme]
- Inspiration: [Reference websites]
```

### Prompt Optimization Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Instead of "nice design", say "minimalist design with blue accent colors"
2. **Include Examples**: "Like Notion's sidebar navigation"
3. **Specify Constraints**: "Must load in under 3 seconds"
4. **Define User Flow**: "Users should be able to sign up in 2 clicks"

## Method 2: Screenshot to Code

### How Screenshot to Code Works

AI tools can analyze visual designs and recreate them in code. This is perfect for replicating designs you admire.

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Find Inspiration**
   - Browse websites you like
   - Check design galleries (Dribbble, Behance)
   - Look at competitors

2. **Capture Screenshots**
   - Full page captures for complete designs
   - Component captures for specific elements
   - Mobile and desktop versions

3. **Prepare Your Screenshots**
   - High resolution (minimum 1920x1080)
   - Clean captures without browser UI
   - Multiple views if needed

4. **Upload and Convert**
   ```
   Prompt: "Recreate this design exactly but with my content:
   - Company name: [Your Company]
   - Tagline: [Your Tagline]
   - Colors: [Your brand colors]"
   ```

### Best Practices

- **Legal Considerations**: Don't copy copyrighted designs exactly
- **Customization**: Always modify to match your brand
- **Performance**: Request optimized code
- **Responsiveness**: Ask for mobile versions

### Tools That Excel at Screenshot to Code
- V0.dev - Best for React components
- Bolt.new - Full applications
- Lovable - Complex interactions

## Method 3: Figma to Code

### Setting Up Figma Integration

1. **Create Figma Account** (free)
2. **Install AI plugins**:
   - Figma to Code
   - Design to Code
   - AI Design Assistant

### Three Ways to Convert Figma Designs

#### Option 1: Direct Link Method
1. Share Figma file publicly
2. Copy the share link
3. Paste in AI tool:
   ```
   "Convert this Figma design to a working website: [figma-link]"
   ```

#### Option 2: Export and Upload
1. Export Figma frames as PNG/SVG
2. Upload to AI coding tool
3. Request conversion with specifications

#### Option 3: Figma Dev Mode
1. Enable Dev Mode in Figma
2. Copy CSS/React code
3. Provide to AI for enhancement:
   ```
   "Take this Figma code and make it functional with [features]"
   ```

### Figma Design Best Practices

- **Use Components**: Reusable elements convert better
- **Name Layers**: Clear naming helps AI understand structure
- **Set Constraints**: Define responsive behavior
- **Use Auto Layout**: Better responsive code generation

## Method 4: Using Boilerplates

### Understanding Boilerplates

Boilerplates are pre-configured starting points that include:
- Project structure
- Authentication
- Database setup
- Common features
- Best practices

### Popular Boilerplate Categories

#### SaaS Boilerplates
- **Shipfast** ($169)
  - Stripe payments
  - User authentication
  - Email system
  - Landing pages

- **SaaS Pegasus** ($249)
  - Django/React
  - Teams support
  - API ready
  - Admin panel

#### Free Boilerplates
- **Create T3 App**
  ```bash
  npm create t3-app@latest
  ```
  - Next.js + TypeScript
  - Prisma + tRPC
  - NextAuth.js
  - Tailwind CSS

- **Next.js Starter**
  ```bash
  npx create-next-app@latest
  ```

### How to Use Boilerplates with AI

1. **Start with boilerplate**
2. **Understand structure**:
   ```
   "Explain the structure of this Next.js boilerplate"
   ```

3. **Add features**:
   ```
   "Add a blog system to this boilerplate with:
   - Markdown support
   - Categories
   - Search functionality"
   ```

4. **Customize design**:
   ```
   "Redesign the landing page with a modern SaaS style"
   ```

## Method 5: Enhancing Existing Code

### Code Enhancement Strategy

1. **Audit Current Code**
   ```
   "Review this code and identify:
   - Performance issues
   - Security concerns
   - Missing features
   - Code quality problems"
   ```

2. **Prioritize Improvements**
   - Critical: Security and bugs
   - Important: Performance
   - Nice-to-have: Features

3. **Incremental Enhancement**
   ```
   "Add error handling to all API calls in this code"
   ```

### Common Enhancement Requests

- Mobile app"
```

## Bonus: Combining Methods

### The Power Stack Approach

1. **Foundation**: Start with boilerplate
2. **Design**: Import Figma components
3. **Features**: Add via prompts
4. **Polish**: Use screenshots for inspiration
5. **Enhance**: Improve existing code

### Real Project Example

Building an E-commerce Site:

   ```
   "Use Next.js Commerce boilerplate"
   ```

2. **Day 2**: Design with Figma
   ```
   "Import this Figma design for product pages"
   ```

3. **Day 3**: Add features
   ```
   "Add wishlist functionality with user accounts"
   ```

4. **Day 4**: Screenshot inspiration
   ```
   "Make the checkout flow like Amazon's"
   ```

5. **Day 5**: Enhance and optimize
   ```
   "Optimize for mobile and add PWA features"
   ```

```
"Match the exact spacing: 24px padding, 16px gaps"
```

#### Issue: Features not working
**Solution**: Break down into smaller requests
```
Instead of: "Add complete auth system"
Try: "Step 1: Add login form"
     "Step 2: Add user registration"
     "Step 3: Add password reset"
```

#### Issue: Performance problems
**Solution**: Request optimization specifically
```
"Optimize this code for performance:
- Reduce bundle size
- Add code splitting
- Implement caching"
```
