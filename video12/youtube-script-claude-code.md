[SCREEN: Terminal showing Claude Code in action, rapidly refactoring code]

10 months ago, I was copying and pasting from ChatGPT like everyone else. Today, I'm shipping production features daily for my startup using Claude Code CLI.

This isn't just another AI tool tutorial. This is the tool that changed everything.

Let me show you exactly how to go from zero to shipping production code with Claude Code.

## Introduction (00:20-00:50)

I'm Vinod Sharma, and I've tried everything - ChatGPT, Bolt, V0, Cursor, GitHub Copilot. They're all good tools. But Claude Code CLI? This is different.

Today, I'm showing you:
- What Claude Code really is (beyond the marketing)
- How to set it up in 2 minutes
- The mental model that unlocks its power
- Real examples from building my startup Sucana
- The workflow that 10x'd my productivity

If you're serious about AI coding, this video will transform how you build.

## What Claude Code Really Is (00:50-02:00)

[SCREEN: Show Claude Code documentation]

Claude Code is Anthropic's CLI tool that turns your terminal into an AI development powerhouse.

But here's what makes it special:
- **200K token context** - Load your ENTIRE codebase
- **Persistent sessions** - Resume work days later
- **Multi-file orchestration** - Refactor entire projects
- **Web research** - Gets current best practices
- **Terminal execution** - Runs commands directly

[SCREEN: Split screen comparing ChatGPT copy-paste vs Claude Code direct execution]

Think of it as having a senior architect in your terminal who can actually write and execute code.

## Installation in 2 Minutes (02:00-03:30)

[SCREEN: Terminal]

Let's get you set up. It's surprisingly simple:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic/claude-cli
```

[Wait for installation]

Now authenticate:

```bash
claude auth login
```

[Show the authentication process]

That's it. You're ready. But most people stop here and never learn to use it effectively.

Let me show you what they're missing.

## The Mental Model That Changes Everything (03:30-05:00)

[SCREEN: Diagram showing the mental model]

Here's the shift most people miss:

**Old way**: "AI writes code for me"
**Claude way**: "AI and I architect together"

Claude Code can:
- Read your entire codebase
- Understand your architecture
- Make design decisions
- Execute commands
- Research solutions
- Debug complex issues

[SCREEN: Show file structure of a project]

It's not about generating snippets. It's about understanding systems.

## Your First Power Move - The README Generator (05:00-07:00)

[SCREEN: Terminal with a sample project]

Let me show you something that blew my mind when I first discovered it:

```bash
claude chat --model opus
```

Now type:
"Analyze this codebase and create a comprehensive README with architecture diagram"

[Show Claude analyzing the codebase]

Watch what happens...

[Show the generated README with ASCII diagrams]

In 30 seconds, you have documentation that would take hours to write manually. But this is just the beginning.

## Multi-File Refactoring Magic (07:00-09:30)

[SCREEN: JavaScript project]

Here's a real example from last week. I had an entire Express app in JavaScript that needed to be TypeScript.

Traditional way: Days of careful refactoring
Claude way: Watch this...

```bash
claude chat
```

"Refactor this Express app to TypeScript with proper types, error handling, and modular architecture"

[Show the refactoring happening]

Look at what it's doing:
- Creating tsconfig.json
- Adding type definitions
- Updating ALL imports
- Refactoring every file
- Adding error boundaries

[Show the transformed codebase]

One command. Entire codebase transformed. This is the power we're talking about.

## The Persistent Session Superpower (09:30-11:00)

[SCREEN: Terminal showing --resume flag]

Here's something nobody talks about - persistent sessions.

Let me show you a real scenario:

Monday:
```bash
claude chat
"Let's design a notification system for my app"
```

[Have a conversation about architecture]

Now watch what happens when I come back Thursday:

```bash
claude chat --resume
```

[Show Claude remembering the entire conversation]

It remembers:
- Our design decisions
- Files we created
- Problems we solved
- Next steps we planned

This is game-changing for complex projects.

## Building a Feature from Scratch (11:00-14:00)

[SCREEN: Empty project folder]

Let's build something real - a complete feature using my daily workflow:

### Step 1: Architecture
```bash
claude chat
"I need a real-time notification system. Analyze best approaches for a Node.js app"
```

[Show Claude's architectural recommendations]

### Step 2: Implementation
"Great, let's implement the WebSocket approach you suggested"

[Show files being created]

### Step 3: Testing
"Write comprehensive tests for the notification system"

[Show test files being generated]

### Step 4: Documentation
"Update the README with the new notification feature"

[Show documentation updates]

In 10 minutes, we've built what used to take days.

## The Image-to-Code Workflow (14:00-15:30)

[SCREEN: Show a dashboard mockup image]

Here's how I prototype every Sucana feature:

```bash
claude chat
```

"Here's a screenshot of a dashboard. Build this with React and Tailwind"

[Attach image]

[Show Claude analyzing the image and generating code]

Look at that - pixel-perfect implementation from an image!

## Debugging Like a Senior Developer (15:30-17:00)

[SCREEN: Show an error in the console]

When things break, Claude Code becomes your debugging partner:

```bash
claude chat
```

"I'm getting this error: [paste error]. Debug by:
1. Checking logs
2. Analyzing stack trace
3. Checking related files
4. Finding root cause
5. Implementing fix"

[Show Claude debugging process]

It found the issue across multiple files and fixed it. This is better than most senior developers because it can analyze everything simultaneously.

## My Production Workflow (17:00-19:00)

[SCREEN: VS Code and Terminal split screen]

Here's my actual setup for building Sucana:

**Morning Planning:**
```bash
claude chat "Review yesterday's work and suggest today's priorities"
```

**Development Loop:**
1. Plan: "Design the data model for [feature]"
2. Build: "Implement what we designed"
3. Test: "Add comprehensive tests"
4. Document: "Update docs"

**Evening Review:**
```bash
claude chat "Audit today's changes for security issues and performance problems"
```

This workflow transformed me from shipping monthly to shipping weekly.

## Integration with VS Code (19:00-20:30)

[SCREEN: Show VS Code with terminal]

The perfect setup:
- VS Code for editing
- Terminal with Claude Code
- Copilot for autocomplete

[Demonstrate the workflow]

Claude handles architecture, Copilot handles typing, you handle decisions.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid (20:30-21:30)

[SCREEN: Show examples of bad vs good prompts]

**Mistake 1**: Asking for too much at once
❌ "Build me a complete app"
✅ "Create the user model and basic CRUD"

**Mistake 2**: No context
❌ "Add authentication"
✅ "Add JWT auth to my Express API using models/User.js"

**Mistake 3**: Not reviewing code
Always review! You're the architect, Claude is your assistant.

## The Cost-Benefit Analysis (21:30-22:30)

[SCREEN: Show pricing tiers]

Let's talk money:
- Claude Pro: $20/month
- Claude Max: $100/month (what I use)

My results:
- Before: 1 feature/month
- After: 1 feature/week
- Time saved: 30+ hours/month

The ROI is obvious. The $100 pays for itself in the first week.

## Your Week 1 Action Plan (22:30-23:30)

[SCREEN: Show action plan]

Here's exactly what to do:

**Day 1**: Install and authenticate
**Day 2**: Analyze an existing project
**Day 3**: Build a full-stack app
**Day 4**: Add authentication
**Day 5**: Integrate an API
**Weekend**: Deploy to production

Follow this plan and you'll be shipping production code by next week.

## Advanced Techniques (23:30-25:00)

[SCREEN: Show advanced examples]

### The Orchestrator Pattern
```bash
"Act as tech lead. Create migration plan from MongoDB to PostgreSQL and execute it"
```

### The Learning Accelerator
```bash
"Explain this open source project as if I'm a new developer"
```

### The Production Checklist
```bash
"Prepare for production: security audit, performance optimization, deployment guide"
```

These patterns took me months to discover. Now you have them.

## The Mindset That Matters (25:00-26:00)

[SCREEN: Show key points]

Remember:
- Claude Code doesn't replace you
- It amplifies your impact
- You still own the architecture
- You still make decisions
- But you ship 10x faster

This isn't about AI vs humans. It's about humans with AI vs humans without.
