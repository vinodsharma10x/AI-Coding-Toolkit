# AI Coding Toolkit

**Transform your ideas into working applications using AI-powered coding tools**

Welcome to the AI Coding Toolkit - a comprehensive resource for learning AI-assisted development from beginner to advanced levels. This repository contains all prompts, code samples, documentation, and step-by-step guides corresponding to each video in the series.

## About This Series

After 10 months of intensive AI coding while building my startup Sucana, I've progressed from simple prompts in ChatGPT to professional development with Claude Code CLI. This series shares everything I've learned, helping you skip the trial and error and jump straight to building real applications.
